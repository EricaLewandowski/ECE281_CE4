ECE281_CE4
==========

The goal of Computer Exercise 4 was to learn and exhibit use of the PRISM language. 

#Discussion

To figure out what the program required concerning code, I wrote out what the end result of each step should be. PRISM file a
loads a the value 9, subtracts 1, and adds 3 for a final value of B. PRISM file b loads some value, doubles the value by adding
it to itself, subtracts four, then outputs to port 2. Lastly, PRISM file c inputs a value from input 3, outputs the value to port 0,
subtracts 1 and outputs to port 1, subtracts one and outputs to port 2, then loops to the first output and subtracts one, and so on. 


#Documentation

I asked Dr Neebel questions during class about what the operations did, and how to figure out which operation to use. I also learned 
that I need to refresh/relearn hexadecimal values.
